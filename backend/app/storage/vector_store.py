vector_store.py - Phase 1, Chunk 4 (ChromaDB persistent storage)

WHY THIS EXISTS:
embedder.py produces chunks with vectors attached, but those vectors only
exist in memory until something stores them durably and makes them
searchable by similarity. This module is that something: it wraps
ChromaDB to store embedded chunks persistently (surviving app restarts)
and to run similarity search against them later, in Phase 2.

WHY CHROMADB: it's a vector database that handles the similarity-search
math (cosine distance between vectors) internally, so retrieval code in
Phase 2 doesn't need to implement that itself. It supports a persistent
on-disk mode, which is what we use here - re-embedding every document on
every app restart would be wasteful and slow.

WHY A PERSISTENT CLIENT, NOT IN-MEMORY: an in-memory ChromaDB client
loses all stored data the moment the Python process ends. That's fine
for a quick test script, but wrong for a real application - a user
shouldn't have to re-upload and re-embed every document every time the
backend restarts. PersistentClient writes to disk at a configured path,
so the knowledge base survives restarts.

A NOTE ON IDs: ChromaDB requires a unique string ID for every stored
record. chunk_document() in chunker.py produces a chunk_id that's only
unique WITHIN one document - if you embed two different files, both
could have chunks with chunk_id=0. This module builds the actual
ChromaDB record ID by combining source_file and chunk_id
(f"{source_file}::{chunk_id}"), which is unique across the whole
knowledge base. This is the same class of problem source_file was added
to chunker.py to solve - citation/storage metadata is only useful if
it's unambiguous across multiple documents, not just within one.

A NOTE ON METADATA TYPES: ChromaDB's metadata fields only accept str,
int, float, or bool - not None, and not arbitrary nested structures.
Since chunker.py's source_file defaults to None for backward
compatibility, this module explicitly converts None to the string
"unknown" before storing, so a None value never gets silently rejected
or causes a storage error at write time.

    WHY hnsw:space="cosine" IS EXPLICITLY SET: this is a real bug found
    during Phase 2 development. ChromaDB's default distance metric, if
    not explicitly configured, is SQUARED L2 (squared Euclidean)
    distance, not cosine distance - confirmed by direct testing (an
    orthogonal vector pair returned distance=2.0, and an opposite vector
    pair returned distance=4.0, which only matches squared L2, not
    cosine). This matters because retriever.py's similarity score
    conversion (1 - distance) is only mathematically valid for cosine
    distance, which has a bounded, predictable range. Without this
    explicit setting, every computed "similarity" score was wrong
    (returning near-zero for genuinely strong matches), even though
    RESULT ORDERING still happened to be correct - which is why the bug
    wasn't obvious from ranking alone and only showed up once actual
    similarity scores were inspected. Cosine distance is also the
    standard choice for text embeddings specifically (it measures
    directional similarity, ignoring vector magnitude, which fits how
    sentence-transformers models are designed to be compared).
