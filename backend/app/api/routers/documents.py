documents.py — Phase 3, document endpoints

POST /documents/upload       — validate, then ingest in background (202)
GET  /documents/             — list all indexed source files
GET  /documents/status       — per-file ingestion status (indexing/indexed/failed)
DELETE /documents/{filename} — remove one document's chunks
DELETE /documents/           — remove all chunks

SECURITY FIXES (all active):

1. FILE SIZE LIMIT
   Files over MAX_UPLOAD_BYTES (25 MB) are rejected with 413 after
   reading bytes but before any disk or pipeline work. Content-Length
   headers are client-controlled and can lie — checking len(contents)
   after the read is the only reliable approach.

2. MAGIC BYTE VALIDATION
   Extension checking is trivially bypassed by renaming a file. After
   reading bytes, _check_magic_bytes() inspects the actual file header:
   - PDF:  must start with b'%PDF'
   - DOCX: must start with b'PK\x03\x04' (Office Open XML is a ZIP)
   - TXT:  must be decodable as UTF-8 (no binary content)
   A renamed .exe masquerading as .pdf fails here with 415, not inside
   the parser with a cryptic 500.

3. FILENAME SANITISATION
   file.filename comes from the multipart header — the client controls
   it entirely. _sanitise_filename() strips directory components
   (preventing path traversal) and removes shell-special characters
   before the name is used as a ChromaDB metadata key or in logs.

4. RATE LIMITING
   Upload is limited to 10/minute per IP via slowapi. The limiter
   instance is imported from main.py where it's registered with the app.

BACKGROUND FAILURE VISIBILITY:
   _ingestion_status tracks per-file state: "indexing" → "indexed" or
   "failed". GET /documents/status exposes this so the frontend can show
   a real failure state instead of leaving the user waiting indefinitely
   for a file that silently failed to ingest.
