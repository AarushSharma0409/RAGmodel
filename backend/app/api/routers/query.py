"""
query.py — Phase 3, query endpoint

POST /query — takes a user query, runs it through the full Phase 2
              pipeline, and returns an answer with citations and a
              confidence signal.

PIPELINE ORDER:
1. route_query()      — decide HOW to handle the query
2. retrieve()         — get relevant chunks from ChromaDB
3. assess_confidence()— judge retrieval quality BEFORE generation,
                        so the signal survives even if generation fails
4. generate()         — synthesize answer with citations

WHY CONFIDENCE BEFORE GENERATION:
If generate() raises GenerationError, the API still needs to tell the
user something meaningful. "Retrieval was weak" is useful information
even when generation failed — it explains why. Assessing confidence
first means that signal is never lost to a downstream failure.
