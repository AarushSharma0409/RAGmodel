embedder.py - Phase 1, Chunk 3 (Embedding generation)

WHY THIS EXISTS:
chunker.py gives us text chunks with citation metadata attached, but text
alone can't be searched by meaning - only by exact keyword matching. An
embedding model converts each chunk's text into a vector (a list of
numbers) that captures its semantic meaning, so later we can compare a
user's question to chunk vectors using similarity math (cosine
similarity) instead of literal text matching. This is what makes "what
did the report say about churn" find a chunk that talks about "customer
attrition" even though the words don't match exactly.

MODEL CHOICE: all-MiniLM-L6-v2 (via sentence-transformers), run locally.
- Free, runs entirely on your own machine, no per-call cost or API key
  needed during development, where you'll be re-embedding test documents
  constantly while debugging.
- Small (~80MB) and fast relative to larger embedding models, while still
  being a well-regarded, commonly-used default for exactly this kind of
  RAG project - not a toy choice, a genuine standard one.
- Produces 384-dimensional vectors - smaller than some hosted models
  (e.g. OpenAI's text-embedding-3-small is 1536-dim), which is a real
  quality/size tradeoff worth being able to explain: a smaller embedding
  space means slightly less nuance captured per chunk, in exchange for
  speed and zero cost. Swappable later for a hosted model if the
  portfolio story calls for it - this module isolates that decision so
  switching providers later doesn't require touching chunker.py or
  anything upstream.

DESIGN: the model is loaded once (lazily, on first use) and reused for
all subsequent calls, rather than reloading it per-chunk or per-document
- reloading a transformer model is expensive (real seconds, not
milliseconds), so this matters for anything beyond a single test run.

A REAL DEPLOYMENT EDGE CASE TO KNOW ABOUT: sentence-transformers
downloads the model weights from HuggingFace's hub on first use and
caches them locally (similar to how tiktoken downloads its encoding
file - see chunker.py). This means model loading can fail in
network-restricted environments. Unlike tiktoken's token-counting
fallback, there isn't a meaningful "approximate embedding" fallback that
makes sense here - an embedding IS the model's output, there's no cheap
substitute. So instead of silently degrading, embed_chunks() fails
loudly with a clear error message explaining what to do about it
(pre-download the model, or check network access) - silently returning
garbage vectors would be far worse than a clear failure, since it would
corrupt retrieval quality without any visible symptom.

    WHY BATCHED, NOT ONE CALL PER CHUNK: encoding all chunk texts in a
    single model.encode() call lets sentence-transformers process them
    together (internally batched on whatever hardware is available),
    which is meaningfully faster than looping and calling encode() once
    per chunk - this matters more as document count grows, and it's a
    detail worth being able to explain ("I batch embeddings instead of
    making N separate model calls").

    Chunks with empty/whitespace-only text are skipped entirely (same
    defensive principle used throughout loaders.py and chunker.py) rather
    than embedding an empty string, which would produce a meaningless
    vector that could falsely match unrelated queries.
