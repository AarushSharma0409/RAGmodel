confidence.py — Phase 2, Chunk 4

Confidence signaling layer for DocMind.

WHY THIS EXISTS AS A SEPARATE MODULE:
- retriever.py computes similarity scores but has no opinion about what they mean.
- generator.py produces answers but shouldn't be responsible for warning the user
  that its inputs were weak — mixing those two jobs makes the warning untestable
  in isolation and means a GenerationError silences the confidence signal entirely.
- This module is the judgment layer between them: reads retrieval output, returns
  a structured signal that the API layer (Phase 3) can surface independently of
  whether generation succeeded or failed.

# Thresholds are named constants so tuning them later means one change,
# not hunting through if-statements. These starting values are hypotheses —

# A single highly-similar chunk gets "medium" not "high" because one chunk
# is structurally fragile: it might be a genuine precise answer (fine) or
# the only partial hit in a weak retrieval (not fine). Two or more chunks
# independently corroborating a high score is a much stronger signal.
