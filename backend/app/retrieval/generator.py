generator.py - Phase 2, Chunk 3 (Generation & Citation Extraction)

WHY THIS EXISTS:
retriever.py (Chunk 1) returns the most relevant chunks for a query, but
raw chunks aren't useful to an end user on their own - they need a
coherent, synthesized answer. This module takes the query plus retrieved
chunks, sends them to Gemini with a structured prompt, and returns a
clean response containing both the answer and traceable citations back
to the exact chunks the answer actually used.

WHY GEMINI, CONSISTENTLY WITH query_router.py: this project's LLM layer
uses Gemini throughout (see query_router.py for the original reasoning -
working credentials were already set up for Gemini, not Anthropic). An
earlier draft of this module was built against Groq instead, which would
have meant maintaining two different LLM providers, two SDKs, and two
auth setups for two halves of one pipeline - a real inconsistency, not
just a style preference. That Groq-based draft is kept in the repo as a
documented fallback option (see generator_groq_backup.py) in case Gemini
access changes, but Gemini is the primary implementation.

A REAL BUG AVOIDED BY BUILDING AGAINST THE ACTUAL retriever.py CONTRACT:
an earlier draft of this module assumed retrieved chunks have a
"chunk_id" field. retriever.py's actual return shape does NOT include
chunk_id - it returns {"text", "source_file", "page_number",
"locator_type", "similarity"}. This module builds citation identity from
source_file + page_number instead (which is what's actually available
and what actually matters for showing a user "you can verify this on
page 4 of report.pdf"), rather than assuming a field that doesn't exist
in the real pipeline.

WHY LLM-SIDE CITATION, NOT POST-PROCESSING: matching generated sentences
back to source chunks via post-processing is brittle - paraphrased
answers won't match chunk text verbatim, and the matching logic becomes
its own engineering problem. Constraining the model (via the prompt and
schema) to only cite chunks we explicitly provide, by index into the
provided chunk list, prevents hallucinated sources structurally rather
than trying to detect hallucination after the fact.

WHY NATIVE STRUCTURED OUTPUT (response_schema), SAME AS query_router.py:
removes an entire class of parsing failure (markdown-fenced JSON,
commentary wrapping) that prompt-only JSON requests are vulnerable to -
see query_router.py's module docstring for the full reasoning, which
applies identically here.

FALLBACK BEHAVIOR - WHY THIS DIFFERS FROM query_router.py'S SILENT
FALLBACK: query_router.py silently falls back to a safe default route on
any failure, because routing wrong (still doing a search) degrades
gracefully. Generation is different - if the LLM call genuinely fails,
there is no safe "default answer" to silently substitute; pretending an
answer was generated when it wasn't would be actively misleading to the
user. So generate() raises a single, clearly-named exception
(GenerationError) on failure, rather than five different exception types
for different failure modes (the earlier Groq-based draft's approach) -
callers need to handle ONE failure case for "generation didn't work",
not enumerate every possible underlying cause.
