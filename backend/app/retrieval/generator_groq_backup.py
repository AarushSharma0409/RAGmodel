generator_groq_backup.py - NOT THE ACTIVE IMPLEMENTATION

This is a backup/fallback implementation of generation + citation
extraction using the Groq API (llama-3.1-8b-instant), kept for reference
in case Gemini access changes or a second provider is genuinely needed
later. The ACTIVE implementation is generator.py, which uses Gemini for
consistency with query_router.py (this project's other LLM-calling
module).

WHY THIS EXISTS AS A SEPARATE FILE RATHER THAN BEING DELETED: it
represents real, working effort (citation hallucination guarding,
structured JSON parsing, a reasonably thorough test suite) and Groq's
free tier with no billing requirement is a genuinely useful fallback to
have documented if Gemini's free tier limits ever become a blocker.
Keeping it as an explicitly-named, clearly-not-imported-by-default file
avoids the confusion of having two active LLM providers in the same
pipeline while still preserving the work and the option.

KNOWN ISSUES IN THIS VERSION (not fixed here, since it's not active):
- Assumes retrieved chunks have a "chunk_id" field, which retriever.py's
  actual output does NOT include (retriever.py returns text/source_file/
  page_number/locator_type/similarity, no chunk_id). Would need the same
  chunk_index approach generator.py uses if ever activated for real.
- MAX_CHUNKS_IN_PROMPT here is a second, independent definition of the
  same concept as retriever.py's DEFAULT_TOP_K and generator.py's own
  MAX_CHUNKS_IN_PROMPT - would need reconciling, not three separate
  constants for one limit.
- Uses several exception types (ValueError, EnvironmentError,
  GeneratorParseError, TimeoutError, RuntimeError) for what
  generator.py treats as one failure case (GenerationError) - see
  generator.py's module docstring for the reasoning on why a single
  exception type is preferred for this use case.

TO ACTIVATE THIS INSTEAD OF generator.py:
1. Fix the chunk_id assumption (see KNOWN ISSUES above)
2. pip install groq
3. Set GROQ_API_KEY in backend/.env
4. Update any code importing from generator.py to import from this file
   instead - and update docs/ARCHITECTURE.md to reflect the provider
   change, the same way the Anthropic -> Gemini switch was documented.

ORIGINAL MODULE DOCSTRING (Groq version):

WHY GROQ FOR GENERATION:
Groq provides a free tier with no billing required, and hosts
llama-3.1-8b-instant which handles structured JSON output reliably.
The Groq SDK is OpenAI-compatible, making the interface clean and familiar.

WHY LLM-SIDE CITATION (not post-processing):
Post-processing (matching generated sentences back to source chunks) is
brittle - paraphrased answers won't match chunk text, and the matching
logic becomes its own engineering problem. LLM-side citation constrains
the model to only cite chunk IDs we explicitly pass in the prompt, which
prevents hallucinated sources.
