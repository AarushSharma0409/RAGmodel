query_router.py - Phase 2, Chunk 2 (Query routing)

WHY THIS EXISTS:
retriever.py (Chunk 1) always does a vector similarity search - but not
every query actually needs one. "Summarize document 2" doesn't need
top-5 similar CHUNKS, it needs the whole document, retrieving only 5
chunks would badly under-serve a summarization request and produce an
incomplete summary. "Hello" or "what can you help me with" doesn't need
ANY document retrieval at all. Blindly vector-searching every query
regardless of what's actually being asked is the naive version of RAG -
this module is what makes DocMind's retrieval strategy-aware rather than
one-size-fits-all, which is one of the project's stated differentiators.

WHY LLM-BASED CLASSIFICATION, NOT KEYWORD RULES: keyword matching (e.g.
looking for "summarize" or "overview") is fast and free but brittle - it
misses natural phrasings it wasn't explicitly built for ("give me the
gist of report.pdf" wouldn't match a rule for "summarize"). An LLM
classification call handles natural language robustly.

WHY GEMINI: this project uses the Gemini API (via google-genai) for the
routing classification step, with a fast, free-tier-friendly model
suited to a simple, low-stakes classification task that doesn't need
top-tier model quality.

WHY NATIVE STRUCTURED OUTPUT, NOT PROMPT-ENGINEERED JSON: the Gemini SDK
supports response_mime_type="application/json" plus a response_schema,
which makes the model's output GUARANTEED to match the given schema -
this is more reliable than asking nicely in a prompt for "ONLY a JSON
object" and hoping the model doesn't wrap it in markdown fences or add
commentary, which is a common failure mode with prompt-only JSON
requests. Using the SDK's native structured-output feature removes an
entire class of parsing failure.

THE THREE ROUTES:
- "retrieve": the default/most common case - a specific question that
  needs similarity search over chunks (e.g. "what did the report say
  about churn")
- "full_document": the query is asking to summarize/overview a SPECIFIC
  named document, not search for a specific fact within it - needs the
  whole document's content, not a handful of top-k chunks
- "no_retrieval": general chat/meta questions that don't need any
  document context at all (e.g. "hello", "what can you do")

FALLBACK BEHAVIOR: if the API call fails (network issue, rate limit,
missing/invalid API key) or returns something unparseable, route_query()
defaults to "retrieve" rather than raising - this is the safest
fallback, since "just do a similarity search" degrades gracefully
(worst case: returns generic chunks, not a crash) while still attempting
to answer the question, which is better than the whole query failing
over a routing-layer issue.

# "type": ["string", "null"] (standard JSON Schema syntax for a nullable
# field). Gemini's response_schema does NOT support type arrays/unions -
# it only accepts a single type per field (STRING, NUMBER, OBJECT, etc.),
# confirmed by a real validation error: "Input should be
# 'TYPE_UNSPECIFIED', 'STRING', 'NUMBER', 'INTEGER', 'BOOLEAN', 'ARRAY',
# 'OBJECT' or 'NULL' [type=enum, input_value=['string', 'null']]". This
# caused EVERY classification call to fail at the API level, silently
# falling back to the default route - the routing logic itself was never
# actually being exercised. Fixed by declaring target_document as a
# plain "string" and having the model use an explicit sentinel value
# (NO_TARGET_DOCUMENT_SENTINEL) instead of JSON null when there's no
# target document - the sentinel is converted back to Python None during
# parsing (_parse_routing_response), so callers never see the sentinel
