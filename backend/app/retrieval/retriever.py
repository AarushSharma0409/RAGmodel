retriever.py - Phase 2, Chunk 1 (Basic similarity retrieval)

WHY THIS EXISTS:
Phase 1 built the pipeline to get documents INTO ChromaDB as searchable
vectors. This module is the first piece of getting information back OUT:
given a user's question, find the chunks most likely to contain the
answer. This is the "R" in RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) - the
LLM's eventual answer (Phase 2, Chunk 3) will only be as good as what
this function retrieves.

HOW IT WORKS:
1. Embed the user's query using the SAME model used to embed documents
   (all-MiniLM-L6-v2, via embedder.py) - query and document vectors only
   mean anything relative to each other if they're produced by the same
   model, in the same vector space.
2. Ask ChromaDB for the N stored chunks whose vectors are most similar
   to the query vector (cosine similarity, which ChromaDB computes
   internally).
3. Return those chunks in a shape that's immediately useful for citation
   (Phase 2, Chunk 3) - text, source_file, page_number, locator_type,
   and a similarity score so the confidence-signaling layer (Chunk 4)
   has something to evaluate.

WHY TOP 5 BY DEFAULT: a tradeoff between precision and recall. Top 3 is
tighter but riskier - with a smaller local embedding model (384-dim,
not the largest available), the single most relevant chunk could
plausibly rank 4th rather than 1st-3rd due to imperfect semantic
matching, and a too-narrow result set could miss it entirely. Top 5
gives the LLM enough surrounding context to synthesize a good answer,
and gives the confidence-signaling layer more signal to work with - "all
5 results have low similarity" is a more reliable weak-retrieval signal
than "all 3 results have low similarity." This is configurable
(top_k parameter), not hardcoded, since the right number is something
to tune once real retrieval quality is observed on real documents.

WHY DISTANCE, NOT JUST "SIMILARITY": ChromaDB's query() returns a
DISTANCE score (lower = more similar), not a 0-1 similarity score
directly. This module converts distance to a more intuitive similarity
score (1 - distance, clamped to [0, 1]) before returning results, so
downstream code (and a human reading retrieval results while debugging)
doesn't have to remember "lower number = better match."

A REAL BUG FOUND AND FIXED: this conversion is only mathematically valid
for COSINE distance specifically. ChromaDB's actual default distance
metric, if not explicitly configured, is squared L2 (Euclidean)
distance, NOT cosine - confirmed by direct testing (an orthogonal vector
pair returned distance=2.0, an opposite pair returned distance=4.0,
which only matches squared L2, not cosine's expected 1.0/2.0). This was
caught when every computed similarity score came back as 0.0 even for a
genuinely strong semantic match, despite RESULT ORDERING still being
correct - which is why it wasn't obvious from ranking alone. The fix
lives in vector_store.py's get_collection(), which now explicitly sets
metadata={"hnsw:space": "cosine"} when creating the collection, making
this module's 1 - distance conversion valid again.
